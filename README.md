# YouTube-Trend-Analytics

## Overview

This project aims to securely manage, streamline, and perform analysis on structured and semi-structured YouTube video data based on video categories and trending metrics. The primary objective is to design a robust data pipeline that can handle large-scale data, store it efficiently, and extract valuable insights.

---

## Project Goals

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Build a mechanism to ingest data from different sources seamlessly.

2. **ETL System**
   - Transform raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.

3. **Data Lake**
   - Centralize data storage from multiple sources for easier access and management.

4. **Scalability**
   - Ensure the system can scale effectively as data volume grows.

5. **Cloud Integration**
   - Utilize cloud resources (AWS) to process and store large amounts of data efficiently.

6. **Reporting**
   - Develop a dashboard to visualize key insights and answer specific business questions.

## Services Used

### **Amazon S3**
- Object storage service offering scalability, data availability, security, and performance for storing raw and processed data.

### **AWS IAM**
- Identity and Access Management for securely managing permissions to AWS services and resources.

### **Amazon QuickSight**
- Scalable, serverless business intelligence service for building interactive dashboards and visualizations.

### **AWS Glue**
- Serverless data integration service to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics and machine learning.

### **AWS Lambda**
- Compute service for running code without provisioning or managing servers, ideal for ETL jobs and event-driven data tasks.

### **AWS Athena**
- Interactive query service for S3 to perform SQL-like queries directly on data stored in the data lake.

---

## Dataset Used

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

### Key Features of the Dataset:
- **Daily Popular Videos**: Tracks up to 200 trending videos daily across multiple locations.
- **Region-Specific Data**: Separate CSV files for each region.
- **Metrics and Attributes**:
  - Video title, channel title, publication time, tags, views, likes, dislikes, description, and comment count.
  - `category_id` field with mappings in a JSON file specific to each region.

---

## Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Download and organize raw data from Kaggle.
   - Store raw files in Amazon S3 for central access.

2. **ETL Process**
   - Use AWS Glue for data extraction, transformation, and loading into the data lake.
   - Implement AWS Lambda functions for specific event-driven data tasks.

3. **Data Lake Setup**
   - Configure S3 buckets for raw, processed, and analytics-ready data.
   - Organize data in a hierarchical structure for easy querying.

4. **Data Analysis and Querying**
   - Use AWS Athena to perform SQL-like queries on the processed data.
   - Explore trends, correlations, and key metrics.

5. **Visualization**
   - Develop interactive dashboards using Amazon QuickSight.
   - Provide insights into video performance, trends, and engagement metrics.

---

## Key Features and Insights

- **Video Performance**: Identify top-performing videos and categories by region.
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyze viewership trends over time.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Evaluate likes, dislikes, and comments for engagement.
- **Category Insights**: Discover the most popular categories and their regional variations.

---

## Future Improvements

- Automate data ingestion and ETL processes for real-time analytics.
- Integrate additional data sources for richer insights.
- Scale dashboards for more granular and customizable reporting.
